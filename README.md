# python-challenge

In this project, I created Python scripts to analyze financial and election datasets. The financial dataset (budget_data.csv) includes information about profits and losses, while the election dataset (election_data.csv) records votes for various candidates.

Financial Data Analysis Objectives:

Calculate the total number of months included in the dataset.

Calculate the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.

Determine the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period and calculate the average of those changes.

Identify the greatest increase and decrease in profits, including the respective dates and amounts.

Election Data Analysis Objectives:

Calculate the total number of votes cast.

Provide a complete list of candidates who received votes.

Determine the percentage of votes each candidate won.

Calculate the total number of votes each candidate won.

Determine the winner of the election based on the popular vote.

Each script was ran independently to ensure correct functionality for the respective dataset.

Tasks were broken down into mini-objectives, leveraging Python's capabilities for data analysis.
